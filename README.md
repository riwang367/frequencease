# FrequencEase

## [BACKEND CODE] Frequency Adjustment API
[Frequency Adjustment API GitHub](https://github.com/JF211859/frequenceaseapi)  
Note: Our app is currently iOS-only as the backend is not compatible with Android. The original backend server was shut down after our final presentation in December 2023 to avoid charges for API calls, and I forked the project in January 2024.

## Note for Testing the App
* The first file upload for the "Import File" button will have an "Unhandled Promise Rejection" warning, but just ignore it and re-upload the file
* Uploading a new file may need to be done twice for the correct audio to play, this seems to be a bug with the package we are using
* Audio for "Record" and "Import File" buttons may come from the phone's top speaker and not the bottom ones
